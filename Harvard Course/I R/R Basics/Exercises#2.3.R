#Excercise on R Basic (I): 2.3 Excercise

#Number 1
n <- 100
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)

#Number 2
n <- 1000
x <- seq(1, n)
sum(x)

#Number 3
###=> Based on the function, Answear is: seq creates a list of numbers and sum adds them up.

#Number 4
log(base = 10, sqrt(100))

#Number 5
log(10^2)
log10(2^10)
log(exp(2))
exp(log(2, base = 2))

#If it as about Output that comeout is numeric, its gonnabe the C, log(exp(2))
